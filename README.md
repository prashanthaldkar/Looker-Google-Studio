# Looker-Google-Studio

E-Commerce website data analysis, we will create a dashboard named Order Summary

The Data we have here is already cleaned so we can directly proceed toward the Dashboard
but before that i have done some data manupulation, as we can see the initial dataset does not have cost price for the time which we can get by substracting profit by sales, we also dont have the number of days it take for delivery to get that information I just simply compute the date difference between Ship date and Order Date and to get a Order Year only column i copied the Order year column and chage the data type to date and year only.

1. First of all you can see on the both side of the heading there are drop down list filters which will help us to specify the Order year and the Segment this makes the whole dhasborad highly . we do not have a Order year(Only) column in our dataset so I have done some data manipulation in the Google studio itself creating a Order year column directly.

2. In first we have here is five cards showing sales, profit, costprice, Avg DeliverDays, Quantity this all is higly intractive we can see them while arranging Segment and Order year using dropdown list

3. The Pie chart present the Category wise sales and Bar chart represent the Sub-Category wise sales and  Sales & Profit

4. The Map and the table shows the state wise sales distribution
